# Flash V-Cam! Now for Flash 5 and MX!

While the V-Cam is public domain code, most implementations are for MX 2004 and later.

You can get either MX or MX 2004 legally, and MX 2004 is unstable, so many go with MX.

This aims to be a resource for Flash MX users who want to improve compositing in their animations.

Have fun!
